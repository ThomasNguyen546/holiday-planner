## Instructions ##

* Upon initially visiting the webpage, the user will be given the option to sign in with existing credentials, or create a new account.
* Once logged in, the user will be directed to a homepage where they will be able to create tasks to add to their to-do list, selecting the type of task, and giving additional input. The user will also see a list of their existing to-do items listed, including options to edit or delete any existing tasks.
* When the 'My Recipes' link in the nav bar is clicked, the user is directed to a separate page that will display all saved recipes, with title, recipe URL, and the option to delete recipes from this list. To view full recipe, simply click the saved recipe title.
* From the saved recipes page, the user can use the 'Search For New Recipes' to be redirected to a page that will pull up a list of recipes, from the Edamam recipe api, based on keywords the user types into the search bar. The user can then save any of the recipe results to their saved recipes list.
